## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Vertical MVP slices; Massive poller deferred to Phase 5 so the simulator path ships first
- [Roadmap]: Docker/scripts/full test suite consolidated in Phase 6; Phase 1 already served by FastAPI on port 8000

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Prior-implementation pitfalls to avoid: Massive prices with missing timestamps looking live, no starting price for new Massive tickers, blocking sqlite in async chat handler, unbounded portfolio history, `lib/` gitignore hiding `frontend/src/lib`
- WSL has no node; use Windows node.exe for frontend tooling
